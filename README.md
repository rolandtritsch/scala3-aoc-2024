# scala3-aoc-2024

Here we go again: [Advent of Code - 2024][aoc2024]!

To make this work you need to run ...

```bash
./mill main.test
./mill main.run
```

**Note**: This time around the focus is on learning `scala3`
and using `GitHub Copilot/emacs` and `Codeium/windsurf` as 
much as possible (as pair programming buddies).
