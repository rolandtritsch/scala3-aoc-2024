/** Utility package to solve Advent of Code puzzles.
  *
  * The aim is to support the following puzzle patterns ...
  *
  *   - Grid traversal/shortest path/all paths (with a path cost/score) puzzles
  *   - Instruction set/state machine puzzles
  *
  * The implementations can be breadth-first or depth-first search. They can also be recursive or
  * iterative. They can use a cache or not.
  *
  * All of these implementation variations can be used for the same puzzle, but with different
  * performance characteristics and memeory requirements.
